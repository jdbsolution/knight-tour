# Knight's Tour Problem

The **Knight's Tour** problem is a classic challenge in chess and computer science, where the goal is to move a knight across a chessboard, visiting every square exactly once. 

## Solution

This repository provides an implementation of the Knight's Tour problem using a **backtracking algorithm**, which explores all possible moves recursively to find a valid path.
