The Knight's Tour problem is a classic challenge in chess and computer science, where the goal is to move a knight across a chessboard, visiting every square exactly once. This repository provides an implementation of the Knight's Tour problem using a backtracking algorithm, exploring all possible moves recursively to find a valid path. For a detailed explanation of the algorithm and the problem, refer to [this article](https://medium.com/@davidlfliang/intro-python-algorithms-knights-tour-problem-ab0a27a5728c).
