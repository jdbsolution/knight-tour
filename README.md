# Knight's Tour Problem

The **Knight's Tour** problem is a classic challenge in chess and computer science, where the goal is to move a knight across a chessboard, visiting every square exactly once. 

## Solution

This repository provides an implementation of the Knight's Tour problem using a **backtracking algorithm**, which explores all possible moves recursively to find a valid path.

### Closed Tour

The knight's final move (step 63) must land on a square that can legally return to the starting square.
